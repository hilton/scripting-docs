# ADR-5 Engine API protocol

## Context

Microservice architectures can choose from many API protocols.
Some messaging protocols offer more efficient communication between services.
HTTPâ€™s widespread popularity makes adoption easiest, due to its simplicity as well as its familiarity.

## Decision

The engine API uses HTTP by default.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

* Developers use HTTP in different ways, and we will have to choose an API style.
* Using HTTP may limit performance, so we may want to support other (message-based) protocols in future.
