# ADR-1 Java core engine implementation

## Context

We can choose between several popular server development languages that developers often use to build server software and that we have experience with.
The newest languages offer other programming styles, such as functional programming, and other potential benefits compared to older languages.
Meanwhile, older languages such as Java offer a much richer enterprise integration ecosystem, and far wider adoption in enterprise environments.
Also, an existing team will typically achieve the most success with the language or technology they have the most experience with.

## Decision

We will implement the core engine in Java.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

We will select a Java HTTP API to use.
