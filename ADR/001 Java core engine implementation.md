# ADR-1 Java core engine implementation

## Context

We can choose between several popular server development languages.
The newest languages offer other programming styles, such as functional programming, and other potential benefits compared to older languages.
We believe that unless it would present a serious problem, we should choose the language and runtime that we have the most experience with.
We also consider runtime popularity in the enterprise environments that we would like to target.

## Decision

We will implement the core engine in Java.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

We will select a Java HTTP API to use.
